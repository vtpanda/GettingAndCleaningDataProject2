# GettingAndCleaningDataProject2
Project number 2 for the Getting and Cleaning Data course on Coursera

The run_analysis.R script takes the data from https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip and creates the tidy data file called SummarizedData.txt. It assumes that the files have been downloaded and unzipped, and that you're working in the unzipped folder.
